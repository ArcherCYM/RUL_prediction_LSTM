***Paper-Reproduce: (Sensors-MDPI) Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method for Bearings Based on LSTM with Uncertainty Quantification***

---

### File Information
1. **"PHM"** is raw data. Data detail information can be obtained in *.
2. **"Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method for Bearings Based on LSTM with Uncertainty Quantification.pdf"** is the paper I reproduce.
3. **"lstm_rul.ipynb"** is all the code.
4. **"data"** is the temporary variables.

### Methods Description
1. Read data amd generate our dataset.
2. Generate **time and frequency domain** features from sampled data.
3. Calculate **correlation, monotonicity and robust** to make feature selection.
4. Build **LSTM Model** and analyse results.
